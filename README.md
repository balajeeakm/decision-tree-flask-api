# 🧠 Decision Tree Employee Attrition Predictor API

This project is a **machine learning deployment example** that uses a **Decision Tree Classifier** to predict whether an employee is likely to leave a company or not. The model is trained on employee data and served through a **Flask web API**, allowing real-time predictions via HTTP requests.

## 📌 Project Highlights

- 🎯 Built a Decision Tree Classifier using `scikit-learn`
- 🧠 Trained on workplace-related features like satisfaction, evaluation, salary, etc.
- 🚀 Deployed as a RESTful API using `Flask`
- 🔬 Tested the model using `Postman` with JSON input
- 📦 Exported the trained model using `joblib`
